# FFT_Simulator_V1.3
 
This project, which I think is very useful especially for embedded software developers, allows you to see the FFT output of a periodic signal you have created. You can also see the FFT output by entering your own samples from the ADC.

The project uses the fix_FFT library that you can easily find on the internet and is completely open source. Although the project is being tested, if you encounter bugs, please report it to me.
